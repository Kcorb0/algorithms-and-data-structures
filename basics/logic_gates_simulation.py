# Logic gates simulation
# AND gates have two input lines, each can be 0 or 1. If both = 1 then output 1 else 0
# OR gates have two input lines, produce a 1 if one or both input lines = 1, if both = 0 result is 0
# NOT gates have one input line, output value is the opposite of the input value, 1 = 0, 0 = 1
# Each gate has a truth table to show the input-to-output mapping
# Gates are split into 2 classes Binary Gates and Unary Gates
